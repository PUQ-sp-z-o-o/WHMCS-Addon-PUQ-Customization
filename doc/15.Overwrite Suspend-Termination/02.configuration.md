**Enabled** - Enabling or disabling all custom functions of this extension affects the automation and visibility of its features in the client area. When extension disabled, the automation capabilities and related features provided by the extension will not be active or visible to clients. However, as an administrator, you will still have access to configure and utilize the extension's functionalities through the administration interface. This gives you the flexibility to control the visibility and automation aspects of the extension based on your specific needs and preferences.

**Overwrite type** - This option determines the scope of the override, whether it applies to individual products or product groups. In this case, the configuration is set to "By products," meaning overrides will be applied on a per-product basis.

**Cron** - This option specifies which cron job will handle the execution of the tasks. The configuration is set to "Each Cron," indicating that the tasks will be processed during each cron run.

**Send Suspension Email** - When enabled (set to "YES"), this option triggers the sending of a suspension notification email to the client when a service is successfully suspended.
