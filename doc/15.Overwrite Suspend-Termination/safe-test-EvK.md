The extension also includes a page called "Safe Test." On this page, the services that are queued for suspension and termination, based on the extension's configuration, are displayed. This feature provides a convenient way to perform a safe test and see which services will be suspended or terminated. You have the option to enable or disable the extension and manually initiate the suspension or termination process by clicking the corresponding buttons: "Run the suspend process" and "Run the termination process."

The table on the "Safe Test" page contains the following fields for each service:

1. ID: The unique identifier of the service.
2. Product Name: The name of the product or service.
3. Client: The client associated with the service.
4. Billing Cycle: The billing cycle of the service (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually).
5. Amount: The amount due for the service.
6. Next Due Date: The date when the next payment is due for the service.
7. Status: The current status of the service (active, suspended, terminated).

This page provides an overview of the services that are in the queue for suspension or termination based on the extension's configuration. It allows you to manually trigger the suspension or termination process for testing purposes, ensuring that you can see which services will be affected without actually executing the action.
