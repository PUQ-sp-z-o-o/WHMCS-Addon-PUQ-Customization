**Weekly Report** - The report is generated every Monday for the previous week (for example, if today is 02/13/2024 (Monday), the report will be for the period 02/05/2024 00:00:00 (Monday) - 02/11/2024 23:59:59 (Sunday)).

<p class="callout info">All data except for unpaid invoices is taken for a specific period (day, week, month). Information about unpaid invoices is aggregated. This means that the report includes the total number of unpaid invoices on your server at the time of report generation and sending.</p>
