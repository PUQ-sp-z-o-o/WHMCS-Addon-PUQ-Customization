You can delete the necessary connection to change the channel for a particular department. To do this, click on the red icon "[![image-1707741931383.png](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2024-02/scaled-1680-/image-1707741931383.png)](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2024-02/image-1707741931383.png)"

### Annotation containing a direct link to discuss

### What new ticket notifications look like

The main view of the ticket has a special structure and represents a link directly to the ticket in your WHMCS: #(Ticket Number) - (Ticket Title).
