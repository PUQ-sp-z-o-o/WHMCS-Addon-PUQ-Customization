To configure notifications for new tickets, establish a connection between departments and channels. You can create this connection by selecting the department and the corresponding notification channel, then click the "Save Changes" button.

You can delete the necessary connection to change the channel for a particular department. To do this, click on the red icon "[![image-1707741931383.png](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2024-02/scaled-1680-/image-1707741931383.png)](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2024-02/image-1707741931383.png)"

### Annotation containing a direct link to discuss

When creating a new ticket, an annotation will appear within the same ticket from the administrator's side, containing a direct link to discuss this ticket on your Mattermost server.
