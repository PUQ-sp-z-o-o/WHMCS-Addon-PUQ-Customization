In the "**Actions**" menu, you have the option to enable or disable Auto CC for all clients with just one click. This convenient feature allows you to quickly toggle the Auto CC functionality globally, affecting all clients on the system.

Additionally, the menu provides a clear overview of the number of clients with Auto CC enabled and disabled. This information gives you a quick snapshot of how many clients have opted to use the Auto CC feature for automated credit card payments and how many have chosen to have it disabled.
