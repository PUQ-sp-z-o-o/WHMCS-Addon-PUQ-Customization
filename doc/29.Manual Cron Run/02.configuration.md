It is crucial that your ionCube version is v12 and above; otherwise, our extensions will not function correctly.

After determining the PHP version of your WHMCS and ensuring that your ionCube is v12 and above, you need to find out where the PHP binary file is located on your server. To do this, run the command "**whereis <span style="color: #ff0000;">your\_php\_version</span>**" in the console, replacing "<span style="color: #ff0000;">your\_php\_version</span>" with your PHP version:

To activate a specific cron, all you need to do is click on "Run Cron Now," confirm the request to execute the cron, and wait until the loader disappears and redirects you to another page.
