**Invoices for cancel** - Unpaid invoices whose products have a status of cancelled and the termination date of the products is not closer than a month ago to the current date.

**Invoices for delete** - Invoice items that have a status of cancelled and the termination date of the products is not closer than a month ago to the current date.

>All of this happens automatically as described in the configuration you've set up, but there's also the option to perform all actions manually.

**Run action Cancel** - Manual execution of the function that changes the status of all unpaid invoices whose products have a status of cancelled, and the termination date of the products is not closer than a month ago to the current date, to cancelled.

**Run action Delete** - Manual execution of the function that deletes invoice items that have a status of cancelled and the termination date of the products is not closer than a month ago to the current date.
