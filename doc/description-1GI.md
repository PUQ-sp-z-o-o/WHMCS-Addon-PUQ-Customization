# Description

The "**Cancellation Request**" extension is designed to streamline the management of invoices, specifically targeting those with products in a cancelled status and termination dates that are at least a month in the past from the current date.

Here are the key functionalities offered by this extension:

1\. Automatic Status Change: This feature automatically changes the status of all unpaid invoices whose associated products are marked as cancelled and have termination dates that are at least a month old from the current date.

2\. Invoice Item Deletion: Invoices often contain multiple items, some of which may be cancelled products. With this extension, invoice items that are marked as cancelled and have termination dates at least a month in the past from the current date are automatically deleted. This helps keep your invoices clean and up-to-date, removing unnecessary clutter and improving overall clarity.

3\. Cron Job Configuration: The extension is configured to execute these actions based on chosen cron jobs, allowing for automated processing according to your specified schedule. This ensures consistency and reliability in managing cancellation requests without manual intervention.

4\. Manual Functionality: While automated processing is the primary mode of operation, the extension also offers manual functionality. This enables administrators to manually trigger the execution of these actions as needed, providing flexibility and control over the cancellation request process.

Overall, the "**Cancellation Request**" extension simplifies the handling of cancellation requests within your invoicing system. By automating status changes and invoice item deletions for eligible products, it helps maintain accuracy and efficiency in managing cancellations, ultimately enhancing the overall invoicing experience for both administrators and clients.
