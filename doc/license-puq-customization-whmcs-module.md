# License PUQ Customization WHMCS module

## Introduction

To start using the PUQ Customization module, you do not require a license. Simply install the modules, and you will have access to the extensions that do not require a license. These extensions are marked as free within the system. However, if you wish to utilize the full functionality of the module without any limitations, you will need to have a valid license for the module. With a valid license, you have the right to fully utilize the module without restrictions for the duration of the license and for a single instance of the WHMCS system.

## Validating License

To check the validity of your license, your WHMCS instance should have access to our license verification servers (IP address range: 77.87.125.0/24).

## Licensing Policy

We value our customers and adopt a customer-friendly approach. If your license expires at any point, we only restrict the management of paid extensions from the administrator's side. It is important to emphasize that all automation and client-side configurations set within the extensions will continue to function as they were before the license expiry.

## Conclusion

A valid license is an integral part of the PUQ Customization module to ensure its proper functioning, specifically in terms of configuring extensions. However, if for any reason the license becomes irrelevant, your clients will not notice the absence of a license, and it will not affect the functionality of your WHMCS or your business operations.

Please note that having a valid license provides you with the complete set of features and benefits offered by the PUQ Customization module, ensuring a seamless customization experience for your WHMCS system.
