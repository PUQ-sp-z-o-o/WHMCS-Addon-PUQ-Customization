### Cancel Fund Invoices

The **"Cancel Fund Invoices"** extension provides the ability to cancel or delete unpaid invoices for credit fund deposits generated by clients but not paid. This extension can be automated using a daily or each cron job.

In the extension settings, you can specify the desired action to be taken with the invoices. You can choose between canceling the invoice or deleting it. You can also configure the number of days of payment overdue after which the selected action will be performed, with separate parameters for cancellation and deletion.

The extension also offers a safe testing mode where you can preview information about the invoices that will be canceled or deleted. If needed, there is a button available to manually perform the cancellation action on the list of invoices, as well as a button for their deletion.

The **"Cancel Fund Invoices"** extension is part of our PUQ Customization module for WHMCS, providing additional functionality to customize the WHMCS system according to your business needs. It is one of the many extensions offered by our module, and you can easily enable or disable it as per your requirements to avoid conflicts with other modules from our competitors.
