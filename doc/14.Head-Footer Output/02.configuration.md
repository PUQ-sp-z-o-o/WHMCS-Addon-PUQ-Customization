On the configuration page, you have the following options:

1. Enabled client area head output: When set to "YES," it enables the display of custom text in the header of the client area. This allows you to insert your own text or HTML code at the top of the client area pages.
2. Enabled client area footer output: When set to "YES," it enables the display of custom text in the footer of the client area. This allows you to insert your own text or HTML code at the bottom of the client area pages.
3. Enabled admin area head output: When set to "YES," it enables the display of custom text in the header of the admin area. This allows you to insert your own text or HTML code at the top of the admin area pages.
4. Enabled admin area footer output: When set to "YES," it enables the display of custom text in the footer of the admin area. This allows you to insert your own text or HTML code at the bottom of the admin area pages.

By enabling these options, you can customize the header and footer sections of both the client area and admin area by adding your own text or HTML code. This provides the flexibility to display important information, announcements, branding elements, or any other content you wish to include in those areas.
