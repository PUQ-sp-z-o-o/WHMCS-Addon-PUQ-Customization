### Link Security and Uniqueness Basics

The uniqueness and security of the generated links lie in their generation process. The link is created using an API key generated upon set creation, the set's ID, and a special key generated from your unique WHMCS code, the set's API key, and the IP address you specified during set creation.

Furthermore, a verification code is also generated using the unique WHMCS code, the set's ID, the set's API key, and the IP address.

Due to this complex combination of parameters, each link generated for every set is unique and is tied to the specific WHMCS instance, ensuring both individuality and security.

Also this ensures that only users with the designated IP address can access the link associated with their set, enhancing its security measures.
