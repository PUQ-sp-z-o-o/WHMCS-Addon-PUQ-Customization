# Client Area Widget

The Client Area Widget consists of two widgets that display the following information:

**Slider Widget**: This widget is designed as a slider and is located on the side. It includes the client's credit balance, a button to add funds to the credit balance, and a toggle switch for automatic credit application. The slider widget provides a convenient and accessible way for clients to view their credit balance and manage automatic credit application.

**Dashboard Panel Widget**: This widget is placed on the client's dashboard and is visible only on the dashboard. Similar to the slider widget, it displays the client's credit balance, a button to add funds, and a toggle switch for automatic credit application. The dashboard panel widget provides an alternative location for clients to access their credit-related information and settings directly from their dashboard.
