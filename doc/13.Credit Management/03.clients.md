On the Clients page of the 'Credit Management' extension, there is a list of clients who have the auto apply credit option disabled. The table displays the following fields for each client:

- Client Name: The name of the client.
- Credit Balance: The current credit balance of the client.

This table allows you to easily view and manage clients who have chosen to disable the automatic credit application feature.
