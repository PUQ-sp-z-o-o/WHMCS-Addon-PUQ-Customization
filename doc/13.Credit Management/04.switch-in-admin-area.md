To enable the administrator to manage the toggling of automatic credit application for a client, there is a position in the "Other Actions" menu on the client's summary tab. From there, it is possible to individually enable or disable credit application for that specific client.

This feature provides convenient access for administrators to modify the auto apply credit setting on a per-client basis, allowing them to customize the credit management experience for each client as needed.
