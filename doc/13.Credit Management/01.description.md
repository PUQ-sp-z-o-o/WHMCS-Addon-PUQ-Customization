## Credit Management

The **"Credit Management"** extension provides clients with the ability to manage automatic payments from their credit balance for invoices. In other words, clients can choose to enable or disable automatic payments using their credit balance and selectively utilize the credit for specific invoices. The key feature of this extension is that it offers this functionality on an individual client level, rather than applying it to all clients collectively as in the standard WHMCS configuration.

With this extension, administrators can enable or disable the automatic credit application for a particular client. The client area includes a widget and panel that allow clients to manage this option. The widget displays the client's credit balance, a button to add funds to the credit balance, and a toggle switch for automatic credit application.

It's important to note that by default, the global configuration has automatic credit application enabled for all registered users.

Ð•he extension provides a list of clients who have disabled the automatic credit application.

Additionally, the extension supports multilingual capabilities, ensuring that clients can access and utilize this feature in their preferred language.

The 'Credit Management' extension enhances the flexibility and control clients have over their credit balance and payment preferences, offering a personalized experience within the WHMCS system.
