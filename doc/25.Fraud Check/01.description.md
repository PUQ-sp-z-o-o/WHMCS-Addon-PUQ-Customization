# Fraud Check

"Fraud Check" is an extension that allows you to check for fraudulent clients using the verification databases provided by [https://fraudrecord.com/](https://fraudrecord.com/) and [https://ipqualityscore.com/](https://ipqualityscore.com/). In the extension settings, you will need to enter API keys for these services. The fraud check can be performed in the following events: when registering a client, when editing a client, when creating an order, and manually.

The extension adds a section in the client view area that displays information about the fraud check. It includes the following details:

- Fraudrecord: Indicates whether any data was found in the [https://fraudrecord.com/](https://fraudrecord.com/) service.
- Fraud IP: Determines if the client's IP address is suspicious based on the data from [https://www.ipqualityscore.com/](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/).
- Fraud Email: Determines if the client's email address is suspicious based on the data from [https://www.ipqualityscore.com/](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/).

Additionally, this panel features a button to view all the raw data collected from the fraudrecord.com and ipqualityscore.com services based on the client's information. There is also a button available to create a report on the fraudulent client and submit it to the fraudrecord.com and ipqualityscore.com services.

When you encounter a suspicious client, you can utilize the extension's reporting feature to generate a comprehensive report based on the gathered data. The report includes relevant information about the client's activities, such as their IP address, email address, and any other relevant data collected during the fraud check process.

Once the report is created, you have the option to submit it directly to the fraudrecord.com and ipqualityscore.com services. By doing so, you contribute to the collective effort of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities across the internet.

The "Fraud Check" extension enhances your ability to identify potential fraudulent clients by leveraging the capabilities of these verification services and provides you with valuable insights to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions.
