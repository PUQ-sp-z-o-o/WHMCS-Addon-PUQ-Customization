When editing an invoice, a section is added to display both the current and frozen data of the client and home company. The frozen data represents the information that was originally frozen when the invoice was created, meaning it remains unchanged even if the client modifies it in their profile.

However, if there is a need to edit the frozen data for any reason, you can click on the "EDIT" button. This action allows you to modify the frozen data, giving you the flexibility to make necessary adjustments.
