# Overwrite Tax Rules

The "**Overwrite Tax Rules**" extension allows you to overwrite and configure tax rules in WHMCS in a highly flexible manner, without relying on the standard WHMCS tax rules. It offers the following key features:

1. Multiple Home Companies: You can configure separate parameters for each home company, including company name, country, tax ID/VAT number, tax name, tax rate, pay-to text, proforma invoice numbering, and invoice numbering. These home companies are used in tax rules and when creating client invoices, providing a convenient way to create multi-brands in the financial aspect of WHMCS.
2. Country Sets: These are groups of countries that participate in tax rule settings.
3. Tax Rules: These rules have parameters for filtering and applying to client invoices. You can specify the client's country or a set of countries to which the rule should apply, the client type (private client, company without VAT ID, company with VAT ID), the home company that will serve the client. You can also set an individual tax rate and tax name to be used on the invoice; otherwise, the parameters from the home country will be used.
4. Freeze Client and Home Company Data: The extension fully supports freezing client and home company data on invoices. This means that the data on the invoice will not change if the client modifies it in their profile. However, administrators have the ability to modify these data.
5. VIES VAT Number Validation: The extension includes built-in support for validating VAT numbers through VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) in the following scenarios: validation when registering a client, validation when editing a client, validation when creating an order, and manual validation.
6. Client Overview Widget: The admin area includes a widget that displays information about the client, such as client type, home company, tax rule number, VIES status (valid) and last validation date, and tax exemption.
7. Invoice Editing: When editing an invoice, a section is added that displays the current and frozen data of the client and home company.
8. PDF Invoice Customization: The extension provides a small integration code for adapting the PDF invoice template.

The "Overwrite Tax Rules" extension fulfills a wide range of invoicing and multi-brand needs that are not achievable through standard WHMCS configuration. Furthermore, this extension is available for free compared to well-known competing modules.
