On the **"Countries Set"** page, you can configure sets of countries that will be involved in the conditions of your tax rules.

To configure a countries set, follow these steps:

1. Assign a name to the set by entering it in the designated field.
2. To add countries to the set, click on the checkbox next to the country you want to include. By selecting the checkbox, you indicate that the respective country will be part of the countries set.

By selecting specific countries for each set, you can define which countries will be considered in the tax rule conditions. This allows you to customize and apply tax rules based on the selected countries within each set.
