3. In the dropdown menu, find and select "Account Statement".
4. You will be redirected to the "Account Statement" page where you can configure the statement.
5. Enter the desired date range in the respective fields. You can choose the start and end dates to define the period for which you want to generate the account statement.
6. Check the relevant content options for the statement. Available options include "Paid invoices," "Unpaid invoices," "Refunded invoices," and "Transactions."
