## Currency Exchange

The **`CurrencyExchange`** extension is designed to manage currency exchange rates within the WHMCS (Web Host Manager Complete Solution) system. The main functionalities of this extension include:

1. **API Integration for Currency Rates**: The extension can connect to external APIs to fetch real-time currency exchange rates that are used within the system.
2. **Currency Rate Settings Management**: Administrators can configure which currencies to update and when, including the option to add a percentage markup to the actual rates for adjusted final values.
3. **Saving Currency Rate History**: Currency rates can be automatically saved in the database on a scheduled basis (CRON) or manually, allowing for tracking changes and analyzing historical data.
4. **Interface for Managing Currency Rates**: The extension provides an interface for viewing and editing current currency rates, as well as the history of their changes.

Additionally, the extension offers the ability to enable or disable its functionality, configure the API for currency synchronization, and manage language settings, making it adaptable to various user requirements and business processes.
