### Blocking Ticket For Guests

Description of the "Blocking Ticket For Guests" extension:

The "Blocking Ticket For Guests" extension is a robust, effective tool for managing ticket submissions within the WHMCS environment. Its primary function is to prevent non-registered users, or guests, from submitting support tickets, thereby streamlining the ticketing process and focusing resources on assisting registered users.

Key features of the extension include:

1. **User Authentication:** The extension implements a user authentication check before a ticket is submitted. If the user is not logged in, they will be unable to submit a ticket.
2. **Redirection of Unregistered Users:** In the event an unregistered user attempts to submit a ticket, they will be redirected to a login page. This ensures that only authenticated clients can interact with the support team through the ticketing system.
3. **Custom Redirection:** The extension provides the flexibility to specify the redirection page. This can either be a specific page set in the configuration or a custom page with a defined HTML message.
4. **Maintained Functionality for Registered Users:** For authenticated clients, the functionality remains unchanged. They are able to submit tickets to the support team without restrictions.
5. **Menu Link Removal:** The extension also removes "Open Ticket" links from the primary and secondary menus for unregistered users, minimizing the likelihood of ticket submission attempts by guests.

One notable aspect of the extension is the ability to customize redirections and messages, allowing it to be tailored to specific site requirements and providing users with a more intuitive and user-friendly feedback system.

The "Blocking Ticket For Guests" extension is an invaluable tool for you seeking to optimize their WHMCS support ticket system, enhancing client navigation and simplifying support operations. With a focus on user authentication, it ensures that support resources are dedicated to assisting registered clients, thereby improving overall service efficiency and user satisfaction.
