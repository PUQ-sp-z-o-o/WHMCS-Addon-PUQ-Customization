# Description

## Client Data Archive

The **"Client Data Archive"** extension is designed to collect and store client data every time it is modified. This extension is particularly useful for easily tracking changes made by clients and finding specific clients based on their updated information.

The primary functionality of this extension is the ability to search for clients who have used the same IP address, allowing you to identify clients who may have multiple accounts. The integrated search feature seamlessly integrates with the WHMCS search system, making it convenient to locate clients based on their ID, IP address, or keywords.3

>Important Note: Actions performed by an administrator while logged in as a client are not captured or recorded by the Client Data Archive extension. The extension records data when clients themselves make changes to their information. Therefore, any actions taken by an administrator posing as a client will not be saved, and the client will not be shown as online during that time. It's important to keep this distinction in mind when using the Client Data Archive extension and interpreting the online status of clients.
