**Enabled** - Enabling or disabling all custom functions of this extension affects the automation and visibility of its features in the client area. When extension disabled, the automation capabilities and related features provided by the extension will not be active or visible to clients. However, as an administrator, you will still have access to configure and utilize the extension's functionalities through the administration interface. This gives you the flexibility to control the visibility and automation aspects of the extension based on your specific needs and preferences.

**Online time -** Specifies the number of minutes since the last online activity of a client to consider them as "online" within the system.

**Enabled Intelligent Search -** Enables the Intelligent Search feature, which extends the search capabilities to include custom searches and return results for entries that may not be searchable using standard search functions. (integrates smoothly with the WHMCS search system)

>Please note that the "Online time" option determines the threshold for considering a client as "online" based on their last activity within the specified number of minutes. The "Enabled Intelligent Search" option expands the search functionality, allowing for custom searches and returning results that may not be accessible through regular search methods.
