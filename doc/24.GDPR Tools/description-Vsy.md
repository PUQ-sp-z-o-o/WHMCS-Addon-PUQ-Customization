The **"GDPR Tools"** extension provides functionality for managing compliance with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) on your website. GDPR is a data protection regulation in the European Union that requires businesses to protect individuals' personal data and give individuals control over their data. GDPR introduces requirements for consent, data subject rights, data breach notifications, privacy by design, and data processing agreements. Our WHMCS module helps websites comply with GDPR by managing consent, handling data requests, and implementing privacy measures.

The key features of the **"GDPR Tools"** extension include:

1. Consent Management: The module allows you to effectively manage user consent for the processing and storage of their personal data. You can create custom agreements and include necessary privacy policies to comply with GDPR requirements.
2. Implementation of Privacy Measures: The **"GDPR Tools"** module offers features that help you implement privacy measures required by GDPR. This includes the ability to pseudonymize or encrypt personal data, control data access, and enforce privacy policies by default.
3. One-Click Data Deletion Request: The extension adds the feature for customers to request data deletion with a single button on the account details page. Once the request is made, a ticket is automatically created and sent to the administrator in the system for further action.
4. GDPR Compliance: The **"GDPR Tools"** extension helps your website comply with key aspects of GDPR by enabling efficient data management and protection of personal information in accordance with the law.

Overall, the functionality of the **"GDPR Tools"** extension allows your website to effectively comply with GDPR requirements, ensuring data protection and providing users with control over their personal information, including the ability to easily request the deletion of their data.
