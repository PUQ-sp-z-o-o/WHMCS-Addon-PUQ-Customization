## Suspend After

  
**"Suspend After"** is a unique add-on that allows administrators to set a date and time for suspending a client's service before the end of the billing cycle. This functionality serves several purposes. Firstly, it enables the automation of service suspension for violations of usage policies. For instance, if a virtual server belonging to a client has been compromised and is engaging in malicious activities, the client is notified and given 24 hours to rectify the issue. If no action is taken within that timeframe, the service will be suspended. This method helps the support team to ensure that problematic services are not overlooked.

Here are four examples of situations where this functionality can be beneficial:

1. Compliance Enforcement: If a client's service is found to be in violation of compliance regulations, such as hosting illegal content, the "Suspend After" feature can be utilized to automatically suspend the service after a specified grace period. This ensures prompt action is taken to address the violation.
2. Payment Reminders: In cases where a client's payment is overdue, the "Suspend After" functionality can be employed to set a deadline for payment. If the client fails to settle the outstanding balance within the specified timeframe, their service can be automatically suspended until payment is received.
3. Resource Abuse Prevention: If a client consistently exceeds the allocated resources of their service plan, causing strain on the server or negatively impacting other clients, the "Suspend After" feature can be used to temporarily suspend their service until the issue is resolved or they upgrade to a higher resource plan.
4. Security Response: In the event of a security breach or suspected malicious activity originating from a client's service, the "Suspend After" functionality can be employed to promptly suspend the service until a thorough investigation is conducted and the issue is resolved, ensuring the security and integrity of the system.

By using the **"Suspend After"** add-on, administrators can effectively manage and enforce compliance, streamline payment processes, prevent resource abuse, and maintain the security and stability of the hosting environment.
