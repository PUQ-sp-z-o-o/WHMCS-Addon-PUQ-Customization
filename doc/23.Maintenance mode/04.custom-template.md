To add your custom template to display in the client area during maintenance mode, you must have WHMCS installed and configured, including our WHMCS Addon "PUQ Customization" with access to the whmcs system and to the whmcs file system with administrator rights.

Your template should be named **custom.tpl**, otherwise, it will contradict the logic of this extension, and your template will simply not be displayed.
It is also crucial that you use the following variables in your template for proper data transmission:

**{$background_image}** - link to the background image

Example usage:

```
<style>
        body {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            background-image: url("{$background_image}");
            background-size: cover;
            background-position: center;
            font-size: 2vw;
        }
</style>
```

**{$logo}** - link to the logo

Example usage:

```
<body>
	<img src="{$logo}" alt="Logo">
</body>
```

**{$title}** - title for the page

Example usage:

```
<head>
    <title>{$title}</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1 class="title">{$title}</h1>
</body>
```

**{$text}** - message about the technical work

Example usage:

```
<body>
	<h1 class="text">{$text}</h1>
</body>
```

To add **a timer**, insert the following code in the appropriate place:

```
{if $enabled_counter eq 'on'}
	{include file='templates/timer.tpl'}
{/if}
```

Now that your template meets the requirements, connect it to the MaintainceMode extension.

Move the **custom.tpl** file to **addons-> puq_customization-> extensions-> MaintainceMode-> templates**

Then, in the configuration, select the Template as "Custom."
