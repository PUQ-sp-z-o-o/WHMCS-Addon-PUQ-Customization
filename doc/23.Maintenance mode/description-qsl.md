The "**Maintenance Mode"** extension provides advanced settings for managing the state of your maintenance page. It offers the following features:

1. Enable/Disable Maintenance Mode: You can easily activate or deactivate maintenance mode, which redirects all visitors to the maintenance page. This is useful when you need to perform technical work on your website or services.
2. Restrict Access to the Admin Area: The extension allows you to limit access to the WHMCS admin area for selected administrators. By doing so, you can ensure the security and confidentiality of your website's backend during maintenance.
3. Redirect URL or Ready-made Solutions in Three Customizable Templates: You have the option to set a custom URL to redirect visitors during the maintenance period or use one of three customizable templates that you can choose from or modify according to your style and brand. These templates provide pre-designed layouts for your maintenance page, making it easy to create a professional and visually appealing experience.
4. Countdown Timer for the Completion of Technical Work: The extension also includes a countdown timer feature. You can display a timer on the maintenance page, informing visitors about the remaining time until the completion of the technical work.

Overall, the "**Maintenance Mode**" extension empowers you to create a customized and engaging maintenance page for your WHMCS-powered website. It ensures that you can inform your customers about scheduled maintenance or temporary disruptions while maintaining a consistent brand identity and user experience.
