## PUQ Customization

Our PUQ Customization module is designed to customize the standard functionality of the WHMCS system. The main feature of our module is that it contains a vast array of extension functions for WHMCS, which sets it apart from similar modules offered by our competitors. Instead of having separate modules for each functional extension, our solution provides a comprehensive set of functional extensions that are regularly updated and added, all in one module. Some of these extensions are also available for free. Additionally, our module offers a convenient and intuitive interface for managing these custom additions.

We value feedback from our clients, and if there is a demand for additional functionality, we strive to release and incorporate it into our module whenever possible. Furthermore, our module serves as an engine for add-ons that can be developed and included by anyone interested, subject to prior agreement and verification. We always credit the authors of each add-on featured in our module.

We believe that our module will serve as a powerful tool for creating a multitude of add-ons, enabling WHMCS clients to comfortably configure their systems to meet their specific business needs.

Please note that our module is not just another theme or hook. It is a collection of logical extensions with customizable options, including the necessary hooks. When it comes to modifying the WHMCS frontend, we strive to develop extensions with a universal graphic design that will be displayed consistently across different themes. Additionally, our module fully supports multilingual capabilities without the need to edit language files. Everything is accessible through the extension's settings, which you can configure and utilize.

Moreover, each extension can be easily enabled or disabled for seamless usage and to prevent any conflicts with other modules from our competitors.
